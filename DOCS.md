## Naming Convention

In Nuxt.js, the naming conventions for files, folders, variables, and methods are influenced by the underlying technologies such as Vue.js and JavaScript. Here are some guidelines for naming conventions in Nuxt:

1. Files and folders:
   - Use kebab-case for file and folder names, as it is the most common convention in the Vue.js community.
   - For example, if you have a component called `MyComponent`, the file should be named `my-component.vue`.

2. Variables:
   - Use camelCase for variable names, as it is the standard convention in JavaScript.
   - For example, `myVariable`.

3. Methods:
   - Use camelCase for method names, following the JavaScript convention.
   - For example, `myMethod()`.

4. Constants:
   - Use ALL_CAPS with underscores for constant names, as it is a common convention in many programming languages, including JavaScript.
   - For example, `MY_CONSTANT`.

5. Components:
   - Use PascalCase for component names, as it is the convention in Vue.js.
   - For example, `MyComponent`.

It is important to maintain consistency in naming conventions throughout your project. Using these conventions will help improve the readability and maintainability of your Nuxt.js codebase.
