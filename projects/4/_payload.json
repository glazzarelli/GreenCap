The system consists of a wind turbine that is equipped with solar panels. When the wind is blowing, the turbine generates electricity, but when there is no wind, the solar panels take over and generate power from the sun.The wind turbine is designed with a unique blade system that is capable of rotating 360 degrees around the central axis, allowing it to capture wind from any direction. The blades are made from lightweight materials, such as carbon fiber or composite materials, to reduce the weight of the turbine and increase its efficiency.The solar panels are installed on the surface of the turbine blades, and are made from high-efficiency photovoltaic cells that can convert sunlight into electricity. When the turbine is not in use, the blades can be tilted to face the sun and maximize the amount of solar energy that is captured.The system is equipped with a control unit that monitors the wind speed and solar irradiance, and automatically switches between wind and solar power generation based on the available resources. This ensures that the system always operates at maximum efficiency, and provides a reliable and consistent source of renewable energy.The wind-solar hybrid technology is ideal for areas with fluctuating wind and solar conditions, and can provide a reliable source of renewable energy throughout the day and night. It is also highly versatile, and can be installed in a wide range of locations, including onshore and offshore wind farms, rooftops, and remote areas.Overall, the wind-solar hybrid technology is a promising solution for renewable energy generation, offering a unique and innovative approach to combining wind and solar power generation in a single system.",1000,"2023-06-15T18:39:07.085Z",{"id":10,"name":18,"surname":19,"image":20,"cv":21,"motto":22,"createdAt":23,"updatedAt":23},"Juan","Rodriguez","juan-rodriguez.jpg","Juan is a civil engineer with extensive experience in renewable energy project management.
