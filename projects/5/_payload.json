The sink is designed with a built-in shredder and a system of sensors and pipes that sorts and transports the waste to the appropriate recycling or disposal location.When waste is placed into the sink, it is automatically shredded into smaller pieces to make it easier to transport through the pipes. The system uses a series of sensors and x-rays to identify and sort the different types of waste, including organic, plastic, metal, and glass. The sorted waste is then transported through a network of pipes to the appropriate location for recycling or disposal.The system is designed to be easy to use, and can be installed in any household or commercial building with a water supply and drainage system. The sink itself is made from high-quality materials that are durable and easy to clean, and the system is designed to be low-maintenance and cost-effective.One of the key benefits of the waste disposal sink is its ability to promote recycling and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or incinerators. By separating the different types of waste and ensuring that they are properly recycled or disposed of, the system helps to reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal.Overall, the waste disposal sink is a promising technology for sustainable waste management, offering an innovative and convenient solution for households and businesses looking to reduce their environmental impact and promote recycling.",2000,"2023-06-05T15:10:41.744Z",{"id":10,"name":18,"surname":19,"image":20,"cv":21,"motto":22,"createdAt":23,"updatedAt":23},"Ahmed","Ali","ahmed-ali.jpg","Ahmed is an environmental engineer with a focus on water and wastewater treatment.

Investing in green buildings is a smart decision for individuals, businesses, and governments looking to promote sustainability and contribute to a better future for all.","Green building is important as it helps in reducing carbon emissions, conserving energy, and promoting a healthier environment . Buildings account for almost 40% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, and green buildings like those that are LEED certified are an effective solution for reducing this impact . Investing in green building has several economic benefits such as operating cost savings and increased asset value . According to a report, green buildings represent a significant low-carbon investment opportunity of $24.7 trillion by 2030, with most of the construction growth occurring in middle-income countries . Green buildings not only lower energy consumption and operational costs but also achieve higher sale premiums and attract and retain more tenants . By investing in green buildings, governments, developers, and building owners can take the lead in shaping and accelerating this multitrillion-dollar business opportunity, while also promoting a more sustainable and equitable future for all.",1000000,"2023-06-05T15:10:41.850Z",{"createdAt":34,"updatedAt":34,"areaId":26,"projectId":10},"2023-06-05T15:10:41.977Z",1685979014886]
