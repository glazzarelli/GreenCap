The process involves taking a small sample of animal cells and then growing them in a lab setting to produce muscle tissue that can be processed and cooked like conventional meat. The goal of artificial meat is to provide a more sustainable and ethical alternative to traditional meat production, which is associated with environmental degradation, animal cruelty, and public health risks. While still in the experimental stage, artificial meat has the potential to revolutionize the food industry and help address some of the world's most pressing challenges.",1000,"2023-06-14T11:36:09.135Z",{"id":10,"name":18,"surname":19,"image":20,"cv":21,"motto":22,"createdAt":23,"updatedAt":23},"Hassan","Santos","hassan-santos.jpg","Hassan is a renewable energy engineer with over 10 years of experience in project development and management.
