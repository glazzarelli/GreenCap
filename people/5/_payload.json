The sink is designed with a built-in shredder and a system of sensors and pipes that sorts and transports the waste to the appropriate recycling or disposal location.When waste is placed into the sink, it is automatically shredded into smaller pieces to make it easier to transport through the pipes. The system uses a series of sensors and x-rays to identify and sort the different types of waste, including organic, plastic, metal, and glass. The sorted waste is then transported through a network of pipes to the appropriate location for recycling or disposal.The system is designed to be easy to use, and can be installed in any household or commercial building with a water supply and drainage system. The sink itself is made from high-quality materials that are durable and easy to clean, and the system is designed to be low-maintenance and cost-effective.One of the key benefits of the waste disposal sink is its ability to promote recycling and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or incinerators. By separating the different types of waste and ensuring that they are properly recycled or disposed of, the system helps to reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal.Overall, the waste disposal sink is a promising technology for sustainable waste management, offering an innovative and convenient solution for households and businesses looking to reduce their environmental impact and promote recycling.",2000,"2023-06-05T21:58:48.403Z",{"team":26,"id":27,"name":28,"image":29,"descriptionShort":30,"descriptionLong":31,"investment":32,"createdAt":33,"updatedAt":33,"personId":4},[14,15,16,17,18],15,"Solar genius","solar-genius.png","Solar Genius is a startup focused on providing renewable energy solutions to homes and businesses.","Solar Genius is a startup that was founded with the mission of promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions.
