","Green roofs, also known as living roofs or eco-roofs, are sustainable roofing systems designed to support vegetation and soil on top of a building's surface. They provide a natural insulation layer, help reduce heat island effect, and absorb rainwater, reducing runoff and improving overall water management. Green roofs can also improve air quality, provide habitats for wildlife, and enhance the aesthetic value of a building. They can be installed on new or existing buildings and can be customized to suit different climates, building types, and vegetation preferences. Overall, green roofs are a great way to promote sustainability and reduce the environmental impact of buildings.",1000,"2023-06-06T07:20:11.593Z",1686037711643]
